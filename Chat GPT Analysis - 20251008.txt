Functional requirements (explicit)

System-admin creation rules

First System Admin account may only be created during system initialization (first boot) or by an existing System Admin.

Secure password handling

Passwords must be stored securely (hashed + salted) and the account model must be 2FA-ready.

Default roles at initialization

System must create these default roles on initialization: System Admin, Client Admin, Property Manager, Reservation Agent, Viewer (customizable).

Role definitions + permission matrix

Every role must include a permissions matrix (CRUD actions per resource).

Admin role assignment

Admins must be able to assign one or more roles when creating or editing users.

Audit trail for user & role actions

All role changes and user actions must be recorded in an audit trail.

RBAC enforcement across APIs

All relevant endpoints must enforce role-based access control according to the permissions matrix.

API conforms to platform standards

APIs must follow established standards for authentication, idempotency, and error contracts.

Integration points / dependencies

Backend must integrate with the Authentication module (login, token handling) and an Audit logging framework.

Database schema availability

Database schema must exist for Users, Roles, Permissions, and Audit Trail (and related mappings).

Functional requirements (derived / implied — “think deeply”)

Prevention of losing admin access

Prevent demoting/deleting the last System Admin (or require a replacement) to avoid lockout.

Role management endpoints

Endpoints to create, read, update, delete, and list roles and role permissions (subject to RBAC).

User management endpoints

Endpoints to create, read, update, delete, list users; include role assignment, enable/disable, and view user status.

Scoped role assignment checks

Admins may only assign roles they are permitted to assign (no privilege escalation via role assignment).

Token/session effects for user/role changes

Role changes, user disables or deletions must cause existing sessions/tokens to be invalidated or otherwise treated consistently.

Password reset & account recovery flows

Secure “forgot password” and reset token flows, plus account lockout and unlock workflows (to support secure password handling).

2FA lifecycle support (2FA-ready)

User model and endpoints to enable/disable 2FA, store 2FA metadata, and handle validation states (without prescribing mechanism).

Audit trail details & queryability

Audits must capture actor id, timestamp, action, target id, before/after values, source IP/user agent, and correlation id; must be queryable and exportable.

Initialization seeding atomicity

Initialization must atomically seed default roles and base permission matrix (no partially seeded state).

Input validation & standardized error responses

All user/role APIs must validate inputs and return a standardized error contract.

Idempotency for create operations

Create endpoints (especially for user/admin creation) must support idempotent behavior to avoid duplicate resources.

Concurrency & transaction safety

Concurrent user/role changes must be transactional/consistent (no race conditions allowing duplicate admin creation or inconsistent permissions).

Pagination, filtering, sorting for listing endpoints

User and role listing endpoints must support pagination, filtering and sorting.

Audit log retention & archival controls (initial policy)

Define retention/archival policy for audit data and ability to export or archive.

Admin activity notification / alerting (optional but implied)

Flag or notify suspicious admin actions (failed attempts at creating admin, mass role changes).

Non-functional requirements
Security & privacy

Strong authentication & authorization posture (least privilege).

Passwords and sensitive tokens must never be stored/returned in plaintext.

Audit logs must be tamper-evident/read-only (operational control).

Protect against brute force (rate limiting / lockout for login endpoints).

Data privacy & minimal exposure (PII minimization in API responses and logs).

Secrets management for any 2FA or token secrets (no leakage in logs).

Reliability & consistency

Atomic operations for user/role changes and audit writes (no partial state).

Prevent administrative lockout (high availability of admin capabilities).

Fault tolerance: system must fail predictably and log failures for ops.

Performance & scalability

User management operations should scale with number of users and roles; listing endpoints must remain performant with pagination.

Audit trail writing must be performant and must not block critical user flows (but must be reliable).

Maintainability & extensibility

Permission matrix must be extensible to add new resources/actions without breaking existing APIs.

Clear API versioning and stable contracts for client compatibility.

Good test coverage (unit + integration) for all security-critical flows (init admin creation, RBAC enforcement, audit logging).

Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) for user/role management and RBAC model.

Observability & operations

Comprehensive logs, metrics, and traces for authentication attempts, role changes, admin operations, and audit writes.

Monitoring and alerting for suspicious or high-impact admin activity.

Support for audit export and secure archival.

Compliance & governance

Retention policies for audit logs and user data; ability to comply with legal/regulatory requests.

Record of who created the system/first admin and when (for compliance).

Data model / schema items (required)

Users (id, username/email, passwordHash, passwordSalt, 2FA metadata/flag, status, createdAt, updatedAt, etc.)

Roles (id, name, description, customizable flag)

Permissions (id, resource, action [CRUD or fine-grained])

RolePermissions (roleId ⇄ permissionId mapping)

UserRoles (userId ⇄ roleId mapping)

AuditTrail (actorId, action, targetId, targetType, timestamp, details {before/after}, ip, userAgent, correlationId)

Sessions / Token store or revocation list (for invalidation on role change)

PasswordResetTokens / LoginAttempts (for lockout and recovery flows)

Critical constraints & edge cases (must be enforced)

Only allow first admin creation during initialization OR by an existing System Admin.

Disallow demotion or deletion of the last System Admin without promoting another.

Prevent non-admin users from assigning high-privilege roles.

Ensure role permission updates take effect immediately and are enforced for all subsequent API calls.

Ensure audit entries are written for every role/user mutation and cannot be silently skipped if the audit system is down (or failures must be visible/handled).

Ensure idempotency for create admin/user endpoints to avoid duplicates on retries.

Acceptance / verification checkpoints (derived from criteria)

First admin can be created only at initialization or by existing admin.

Default roles exist after initialization.

Role permission matrix is present and enforced.

Admins can assign roles during create/edit operations.

All role changes and user actions appear in the audit trail with required fields.

Passwords are stored securely and accounts are 2FA-ready (flag/metadata present).

API conforms to platform standards: auth, idempotency behavior, and standardized error contracts.

Attempting to remove the last System Admin is rejected.
